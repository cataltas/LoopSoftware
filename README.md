# Documentation Generator (Summer 2017)

The JavaScript code present in this repository, docgenerator.js, was written by Camille Taltas, under the supervision of Loic Portales. It provides a tool, now in production, to automatically generate the documentation of the classes used in the Loop software. This tools reads in Javascript objects and produces HTML pages. In order to be more efficient, functions were written to run asynchronously.
